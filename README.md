# FootballApp

FootballApp is a simple app to reading sports articles, watching videos, and bookmarking these elements. There is also a whole authentication service (login, registration, modifying account data), commenting article, and sharing article services. It has been written using the bloc pattern to state management, firebase (cloud firestore, firesbase storage, firebase authentication) and local database hive. Below I have putted links to the apis. Screenshots are in the assets directory.
